# House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using multiple input features by applying a multiple linear regression model.

## Dataset
- Public housing dataset
- Target variable: House Price

## Approach
- Trained a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated performance using R², MAE, and RMSE
- Data visualization 

## Results
- MSE: $1,754,318,687,330.66
- RMSE: $1,324,506.96
- R²: 0.653 (65%)

## Graphs
- Actual price vs Predicted price plot
- Residuals vs Predicted plot
